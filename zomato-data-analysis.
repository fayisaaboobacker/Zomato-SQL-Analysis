**INTRODUCTION**

This project aims to explore medium to advanced SQL queries by applying them to a small, fictional dataset about Zomato. The dataset is designed from scratch using SQL to facilitate learning, 
rather than focusing on real-world data analysis. In real-world scenarios, understanding data can be challenging; therefore, this project prioritizes mastering different SQL techniques and metrics, 
helping to build a strong foundation for more complex data analysis tasks in the future.
